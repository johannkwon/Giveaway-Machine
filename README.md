# Giveaway-Machine

Hello! This is a giveaway randomizer I made for Thrift Studio Co.

It has multiple randomizer functions:
- A normal randomizer that picks a winner(s)
- A tiered randomizer that allows you to set up different tiers of prizes and choose a winner(s) for each one

You can either use a preexisting text file that has names (one name per line) or manually input names with any amount of repeats.

Tiered randomization will choose from the entire pool, and chooses the results either top down (Tier 1 -> Tier 2 -> Tier 3) or bottom up (Tier 3 -> Tier 2 -> Tier 1).
